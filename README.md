# New_York_State_Court_of_Appeals
## Introduction
Predicting the outcomes of appealed court cases is of significant interest to actors involved in legal proceedings. Courts of appeals act as a check on lower courts to ensure that miscarriages of justice do not occur. While considerable empirical legal research has been produced, the use of machine learning and other data science tools is new to this research space.

## Feature Engineering
Extract content that may be relevant to charge outcome (reverse/affirm).

## Future work
Improve feature extraction to get higher quality and more relevant content.
Add n-gram and tf-idf.
Build predictive model.
